# Machine-Learning-with-Python

Welcome to my repository documenting the learning journey through various machine learning techniques and models. This collection encapsulates my hands-on experience with a range of methodologies aimed at both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Including Regression and Classification Models, Clustering Techniques, and Recommendation Systems.

Introduction and Data Processing:
    
   * Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas
   * Statics and Plots:
        * varianse, mean, mode, median
        * Box Plot
        * Skewness and Quartiles
        * Q-Q Plot
        * Histogram Analysis
        * Correlation Detection
          
   * Data Cleaning
   * Normalizing
   * Missed Data

Regression :
    
   * Simple Liner Regression
   * Multiple Inputs
   * Polynominal Regression
   * NoneLiner Regression
    
Classification:

   * KNN
   * Decision Tree
   * Logestic Regression
   * Separated vector machine
   
Clustering:
  
   * KMeans
   * Hieracialy
   * DBSCAN

Recommandation systems:
